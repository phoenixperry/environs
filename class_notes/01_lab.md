Week 01 Lab 

1. Snake. 
Take a sheet of paper and draw a line. Divide that line into four parts. Starting at one end of the line, proceed to the end of the line using a set of rules, actions and goals you define. 


2. Download and install Unity LTS Release 2018.4.14f1
https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases
Try and code 
This is important. DO NOT install the latest version of Unity. This is a hellscape of epic proportion. Hose with fire. Beat with a shoe. Unity is having a moment and the company is trying to do too much too fast and making the mistake of doing it in the light of day verses internally and then issuing a major release. The releases from 2019 should all be considered beta releases. Most function in limited capacity and for that reason, we will not touch it in this class. There are some cool features, none of which seem to work completely. All of which will lead you to fighting rendering pipelines in the end. Just say no. Stay with 2018. (Unless you want to be responsible for all your own errors, such as the random ones which just magically appear even when there is no code in your project at all. Yes, it's that bad. 

3. Grab this week's Unity creative Coding examples from Github. Try some out on your own. What can you make using these as a base?  

4. Listen to 99 percent invisible's episode on architecture and play

4. Read Chapters One and Two of Emotional Design 

5. Read Chapters 1 & 2 of Games Design and PLay by Colleen Macklin and John Sharp 


Bonus round for devs who feel curious: 
-- 
3. Read about Conway's Game of life: https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/
Try the experiments out. 
Since you have never coded in p5 before or processing, I'm going to suggest just using the processing IDE and grabbing it from the main website:https://processing.org/ 
It looks exactly like Arduino so this should not be so uncomfortable. 
Now, have a play. What can you do with this?
