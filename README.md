## Introduction  

What are the keys to creating successful playable spaces?  What kinds of digital experiences work in physical environments? This unit is uses research lead teaching to focus on developments in experience design and playable environments. You will brainstorm, pitch and storyboard experience design. 

Particular attention will be paid to critical interventions using technology and play in public space. Exploring how narrative in spatial environments leverages technology in multiple contexts such as theatre and museum installations, you will discuss how immersive environments create meaningful moment to moment immersion. New experiments in multi and cross sensory based experience design will inspire students to explore wearables research. We will also cover user testing and iteration to design play experiences using a mixed methods approach.

### Indicative Content 

•    Brainstorm ideas for advanced immersive experiences
•    Pitching physical experiences for critical feedback
•    Design and evaluate user feedback to improve environmental design through iteration
•    Construct novel and experimental environmental storytelling in spaces

### On completion of this unit you will be able to:

* Rapid prototype, pitch and execute a playable experience in a complex spatial environment (Realisation)
* Leverage the body in advanced ways in playable spaces (Process)
* Perform advanced user tests and analyse playtest results (Enquiry)
* Use innovative sensory triggers and digital information in physical environments (Knowledge)
* Create innovative interactive playable spaces which use narrative in an environmental contexts (Realisation)

Assessment Requirements

### Assessment: 
Original creative work: Using physical environmental design techniques, students should use iterative design to create an immersive computational environment. (100%)
